                        <hr>
                        <p>As an intern at mbyn Labs, I have had the amazing opportunity to immerse myself in a professional working environment.
                            Although this role is ongoing, I have already been able to accomplish a lot; I collaborated with management to create a full-stack project, 
                            implementing a fully functional back-end and user interface. Much of this role calls for self-directed learning, 
                            but also encourages taking the initiative to request assistance if required. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This experience not only confirmed a programming based occupation as a sustainable career-path for me, 
                            but honed my abilities in critical thinking and problem-solving.

                        <p>
                            My role as a Resident Assistant has been the most rewarding role I have had thus far. 
                            In this position, I have numerous responsibilities. 
                            Some of which include the attendance of routine meetings to organize events and performing “on-call” shifts. 
                            The latter obligation calls for systematically inspecting the residence building according to procedures, 
                            ensuring that students are safe and following university dorm regulations. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although demanding at times, this role improved my stress tolerance, 
                            and ultimately developed my time-management skills.

                        <p>
                            One of my most memorable obligations was as a First Year Representative for the FIlipino Student Association. 
                            During this time I collaborated with a skilled team to develop events for the student body. 
                            My responsibilities included discussing logistics (scheduling, space-bookings and finances), 
                            and promoting events to fellow first-year students. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This experience developed strong coordination skills in regards to event scheduling and planning, 
                            and motivated me to become an advocate for on-campus cultural representation.

                        <p>
                            As a Math Clinic tutor, I was able to solidify my understanding in fundamental concepts of calculus, 
                            through the instruction of younger students ranging from grades 9 - 11. 
                            Some of the topics discussed included Limits, and practical applications of derivatives. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This experience reaffirmed my passion for math and strengthened my strategic leadership skills, 
                            as I modified my teaching approach based on the student.
