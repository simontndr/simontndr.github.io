                                    I have substantial experience in web development, having made several websites.
                                    My knowledge is the culmination of self-teaching and the completion of a university course (CIS1050). 
                                    Here is a sample of one my projects.

                                    In developping this product, I was able to test out new CSS properties — i.e border-image — 
                                    and experiment with a previously unfamiliar layout technique — flexbox. 
                                    Using peer feedback, I was able to refine the final design for usability.

                                Throughout my academic career, I have been able to develop a solid proficiency in C programming through coursework. 
                                For this sample assignment, I was responsible for reading and writing records from an external file onto a linked list. 
                                The final program can perform several operations, including sorting the records, removing records, 
                                and adding records. Regarding the development process, I cloned a GitLab repository to a remote linux server. 
                                I chose to avoid external IDEs such as VSCode and opt for nano on terminal, 
                                as I wanted to refine my error checking skills and familiarize myself with makefiles and local commands.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Through this assignment I reinforced my understanding of fundamental concepts such as file management, memory allocation, 
                                sorting algorithms, and linked lists. Much of the process included taking the initiative to attend office hours for clarifying project specifications.

                                One of my favourite side projects thus far was a “stock management system”. 
                                This program called for me to learn a new programming language — Java. 
                                The program was meant to simulate being a stockbroker, where one could add and remove users from the system, 
                                buy and sell stocks, and simulate market movement — stocks would fluctuate in value, 
                                reflecting in the users’ respective accounts.

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The main outcome of this project was grasping the concept of object oriented programming. 
                                At first, I faced challenges in employing classes and objects, 
                                but persevered out of my personal motivation to grow.

                                In my software design course, we are required to complete a final term project, 
                                using Statistics Canada’s job vacancies data set. 
                                Collaborating with a team, questions of interest were formulated. 
                                Afterwich, a preliminary processing script was developped for the gross data set, 
                                to isolate relevant records. 
                                I created a final script to rank and format the data for visualization with Pandas, 
                                MatPlotLib and Seaborn. In this case, the question of interest was 
                                “For a given province, what are the top occupations with the most openings that require less than 1 year of experience?”. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This undertaking provided me with the unique opportunity to employ agile development as a student. 
                                At the beginning of the project, everyone was assigned a role — mine was “Agile Lead”. 
                                In this position, I was able to facilitate daily scrums, and ensure adherence to current sprint goals. 
                                I was also able to develop strong presentation skills, as we were responsible for presenting demos at the end of each milestone.
